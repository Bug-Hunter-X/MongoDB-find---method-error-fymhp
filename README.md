# MongoDB find() method error
This repository demonstrates an uncommon error related to the MongoDB find() method and provides a solution.

## Issue Description
The provided JavaScript code showcases a potential error where the find() method is used without proper cursor handling and connection closure. This can lead to performance issues and resource leaks.

2. Install the MongoDB Node.js driver: `npm install mongodb`
3. Run the `bug.js` script.  Note any warnings or unexpected behavior. 
4. Observe the improved behavior of `bugSolution.js`
